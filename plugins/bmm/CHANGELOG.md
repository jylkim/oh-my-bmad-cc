- `omb-domain-research-parallel`: fix research steps path to `_bmad/bmm/1-analysis/research/bmad-domain-research/domain-steps`
- `omb-market-research-parallel`: fix research steps path to `_bmad/bmm/1-analysis/research/bmad-market-research/steps`
- `omb-technical-research-parallel`: fix research steps path to `_bmad/bmm/1-analysis/research/bmad-technical-research/technical-steps`

## [0.7.1] - 2026-03-19

### Changed
- `omb-create-story-parallel`: Scope Discovery questions now require context explanation and recommendation before asking, improving user decision-making experience
- `omb-create-story-parallel`: Scope Discovery uses interactive ask-and-wait pattern instead of batched questions

## [0.7.0] - 2026-03-18

### Removed
- Next Step Handoff from all parallel skills (`omb-create-story-parallel`, `omb-dev-story-parallel`, `omb-code-review-parallel`)

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- Scope Discovery phase in `omb-create-story-parallel` — narrows development goals with the user after artifact analysis, before parallel research

### Changed
- `omb-create-story-parallel`: artifact analysis now runs sequentially by team lead; parallel agents reduced to 2 (architecture + tech research)
- `omb-create-story-parallel`: removed `artifact-analyst` persona (no longer spawned as teammate)

## [0.5.1] - 2026-03-16

### Changed
- Standardize all parallel skills to Phase structure with tracked tasks and aggregate dependencies
- Unify spawn prompt format, task completion marking, and heading levels across all pipeline skills

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- Next Step Handoff to pipeline skills — auto-suggests the next skill on completion via AskUserQuestion
  - `omb-create-story-parallel`: suggests ATDD (TEA) or Dev Story
  - `omb-dev-story-parallel`: suggests Test Automation (TEA) or Code Review
  - `omb-code-review-parallel`: suggests Test Review / Simplify on pass, rework path on failure (severity-based)

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-13

### Changed
- BMM 스킬 이름에서 `bmm-` 네임스페이스 제거 (`omb-bmm-*` → `omb-*`)
